# Nippon Colors (CSS)

easily use Nippon Colors via CSS variable.

## Usage

In your html:

```html
<link href="nipponcolors.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

or in your css:

```css
@import "nipponcolors.css";
```

and use as

```
element{
    color: var(--nc-gunjyo); /*群青*/
}
```

I also created this if you uses to replace Bootstrap's theme color:

```html
<!-- introduce bootstrap first-->
<link href="nipponcolors-bs5.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```
